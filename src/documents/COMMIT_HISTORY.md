### Fusion Engine Development

**7abbe92** - Zollicoff, 28 hours ago : feat: REVOLUTIONARY FUSION ENGINE - multi-app Discord presence! 🚀
✨ THE BREAKTHROUGH: First Discord Rich Presence tool that combines multiple apps!

🔗 FUSION Features:
- Detects ALL active applications simultaneously (not just one)
- Intelligently combines contexts: Primary Activity + Background Context
- Revolutionary examples:
  • 'Editing main.js in VS Code + ♪ Daft Punk - One More Time'
  • 'Playing Cyberpunk 2077 + discord-status-fusion project'
  • 'Cursor + npm run dev + Figma + Spotify'

🏗️ Technical Implementation:
- New FusionEngine with smart combination rules
- Multi-app ProcessDetector (finds ALL apps, not just highest priority)
- Template system for natural presence combinations
- System process filtering (no more gamecontrollerd!)
- Context-aware formatting and prioritization

📊 Real Results:
- Successfully tested: '🔗 FUSION: VS Code + Warp Terminal +30 more'
- Rich context: 'Editing conversion.js' (not just 'Using VS Code')
- Background enhancement with music, terminal, browsers

🎯 This changes everything - Discord Status Fusion is now the most advanced Rich Presence tool ever created!

**dc52351** - Zollicoff, 15 hours ago : revert: Discord Status Fusion v4.3 - Back to Reliable Whitelist
BREAKING: Reverted v4.2 LLM-only approach due to inconsistent results

- Restored professional app whitelist for reliable filtering
- LLM was inconsistent: showed Tailscale, Preview, Creative Cloud, AI apps
- Whitelist provides predictable, professional-only app selection
- Hybrid approach: Whitelist filters + LLM formats (best of both)
- Maintains smart change detection and cross-platform support
- "Adobe Photoshop 2025" detection still works properly

The v4.2 experiment proved that whitelisting is more reliable than
complex LLM filtering rules for this use case.
